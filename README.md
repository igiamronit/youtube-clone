# Youtube Clone

A youtube clone to learn basics of html and css.  
I also used this to setup git in my windows machine.  


## How to run this on your own machine?
1. Fork the repo.
2. Run index.html.

I used only two different videos in the project to not waste time downloading different videos thumbnail, channel pics and all.
